# Sylvan.Data.Excel Release Notes

_0.4.6_
  - Allow enumerating and opening specific worksheets.

    value is dynamically determined when accessed via `ExcelDataReader.GetValue(int)`.

   to be read incorrectly.

  - Fix .xlsx string handling for rare whitespace in shared string table.
  - Fix .xlsx whitespace handling to correctly preserve whitespace when reading and writing.

  - Fix ExcelDataWriter formatting to use InvariantCulture to provide consistent behavior in all cultures.

_0.4.1_
  - Fix version metadata format written by ExcelDataWriter which was causing warnings on some machines.

  - Support for reading enum values via `GetFieldValue<T>()`.
  - Add support for `GetChar(int ordinal)`.
  - Add `IExcelSchemaProvider.GetFieldCount(ExcelDataReader)` to allow the provider to explicitly
    define the number of columns. Previously, the number of columns in the current row would be used.
  - Fix an issue where calling `Initialize()` on the first row would not work as expected.

_0.2.3_
  - Fix an issue where a trailing row appears empty, but contains a cell with an empty string value. 
    Previously, calls to `Read()` would return `true` and there rows would be processed. 
    With this fix, these rows will be skipped `Read()` will return `false`.

_0.2.2_
  - Add the ability to convert string to boolean in GetBoolean via `ExcelDataReaderOptions.True/FalseString`.
